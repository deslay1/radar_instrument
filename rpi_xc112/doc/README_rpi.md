## 1 Setup Raspberry Pi 2 or 3

- Download the latest version of Raspbian (as of writing Stretch) from <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>.
- Write the Raspbian img-file to an SD card. Do __not__ copy the file to the SD-card, it wont work. Check <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/> if you are unsure.
    - First, make sure that you have extracted the img file from the downloaded zip.
	- If you are using Windows/OS X or are a Linux GUI fan, download an image burner software, like Etcher,
	  and use that program to write the image to the SD-card.
	- If you like Linux terminal solutions:
		- Make sure to unmount (umount) the SD-card partitions, probably located down the /media directory.
		- Run "dd" from the command line and then flush the disks by running "sync":
			- $ sudo dd if=~/Downloads/2017-08-16-raspbian-stretch.img of=/dev/mmc\<something\> bs=4M
			- $ sync
- Connect the keyboard, mouse and monitor to the raspberry.
- Put the SD-card into the raspberry and boot.
- Connect to WiFi.
- Start a terminal window and type "sudo raspi-config"
	- In Localisation Options, select the appropriate timezone.
	- In Interfacing Options, enable SPI and I2C and the SSH interfaces.
- Type command "sudo apt-get update" to fetch info about the latest software version.
- Type command "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" to update to the latest software version.
- Reboot the Raspberry Pi.
- Connect once again to the Raspberry and find the wireless IP address:
	- Type "ifconfig wlan0" and SSH to this address in the future.

## 1.1 Connect to Raspberry Pi with ethernet cable

Make the following modifications on the raspberry Pi. When connected with ethernet cable, the ip address will be 10.0.0.1.

Edit `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`
```
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

At the bottom, uncomment and edit
```
interface eth0
static ip_address=10.0.0.1/24
```

Install `dnsmasq`
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
```

Edit `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`
```
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```

Around line 106, uncomment and edit
```
interface=eth0
```

Around line 157, uncomment and edit
```
dhcp-range=10.0.0.2,10.0.0.99,12h
```

To apply changes, reboot or restart `dnsmasq`
```
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```

## 2 Development environment

The software can be built either on a standalone Linux system or directly on the
Raspberry Pi. Both methods should work equally well.

### 2.1 Setup for development on Raspberry Pi

Make sure that the following packages are installed: gcc, make.
Use "apt-get install [package]" if needed.

### 2.2 Setup for development on standalone Linux system

The instructions are verified for Debian-based Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu).

Make sure that the following packages are installed: gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf, make
Use "apt-get install [package]" if needed.

## 3 Distributed files

Extract the zip-file you got from Acconeer and look at the file structure.

- makefile and rule/ contain all makefiles to build the example programs.
- lib/*.a are pre-built Acconeer software.
- include/*.h are interface descriptions used by applications.
- source/example_*.c are applications to use the Acconeer API to communicate with the sensor.
- source/acc_board_*.c are board support files to handle target hardware differences.
- source/acc_driver_*.c are hardware drivers supposed to be customized to match target hardware.
- source/acc_os_*.c is the operating system support module. It is not meant to be modified, but is provided
  for reference.
- doc/ contains HTML documentation for all source files. Open doc/rss_api.html .
- out/ contains pre-built applications (same as executing "make" again).

## 4 Building the software

- Enter the directory that you extracted in section 3.
- To build the example programs, type "make" (the ZIP file already contains pre-built versions of them).
- All files created during build are stored in the out/ directory.
- "make clean" will delete the out/ directory.

## 5 Executing the software

First you need to transfer the executable to the Raspberry Pi (unless the zip-file was already extracted to the Raspberry Pi.).

Then start the application using:

- ./out/example_detector_distance_and_service_rpi_&lt;board and sensor version&gt;
